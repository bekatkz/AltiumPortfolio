# My Hardware Projects Portfolio
Welcome! This repository is a central hub for all my hardware design and embedded systems projects. It includes schematics, PCB layouts, firmware, and documentation for various devices Iâ€™ve developed or prototyped.
# About
This portfolio showcases my work in electronics design, embedded programming, and system integration. Projects here range from rocket flight instrumentation to general-purpose sensor boards.

My focus areas include:

PCB design using Altium Designer.

Embedded systems development with STM32 and other MCUs.

Low-power and compact sensor systems.

Reliable data logging and storage solutions.

Mechanical integration and ruggedization for harsh environments.

#  Purpose
This repository serves as:

My personal archive of hardware work.

A demonstration of my skills in electronics and embedded systems.

A resource for collaboration and sharing ideas with others.
