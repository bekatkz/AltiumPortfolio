# Sensor Board Description
The Sensor Board is a compact PCB dedicated to mounting and connecting the pressure sensors and IMU.

# Key functions:

Hosts two I2C pressure sensors for measuring nosecone pressures.

Integrates an IMU to detect lift-off and dynamic flight events.

Connects to the Main Board via wiring with strain relief to handle vibration and shock.

Routes I2C lines cleanly to minimize noise and interference.

# Features:

Designed to fit within the 27â€¯mm diameter constraint of the nosecone.

Supports independent I2C buses if required for sensor compatibility.

Mechanically optimized for secure sensor placement and reliable connections.
